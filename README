This ruby script is used for crawling a neat ouptut containing the title and abstract of each article in proceedings found in the ACM Digital Library. This script requires an installation of Firefox, and Ruby (if you are unfamiliar with Ruby, you should find out how to install it using a version manager such as RVM or rbenv). 

The given url should be one where the table of contents of the proceedings is already opened as a tab, or one that is in single page view.
